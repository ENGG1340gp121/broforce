## Description





## Features and coding requirements
* We will generate enemies that will appear in random locations (Generation of random game sets or events)
* The player, enemies, bullets, ... are all implemented as `class` (Data structures for storing game status)
* We use `std::vector` to maintain all the bullets and enemies inside the frame. (Dynamic memory management)
* File IO: we use File IO to store and read the rank of scores of players.
* Our program code is splitted into multuple files based on class. (Program codes in multiple files)

## Libraries
We mainly use `curses.h` library.
